# UbuntuTouchHTCOneM7

## Contributions/Donations
I don't require anyone to pay, as the things used are free, and I don't believe in paying for free software. I also don't require donations (mainly because I have no way of accepting them). What you can do if you want to is testing the software on your own device, and helping with the things that may need fixing.
